  Welcome to the CellML.org Model Repository curation tracker. Please help us
  by identifying issues, bugs or enhancements to our models. This is the place
  to submit queries pertaining to curation and validation of CellML models.
</p>

<a name="step1"></a>
<h3>Step 1 of 3 - has your question / problem already been answered / reported?</h3>

<p>
  Please begin by conducting a search of issues that might be related to your own.
</p>

<a name="step2"></a>
<h3>Step 2 of 3 - give information</h3>

<p>
  If you've tried a few searches and your [% terms.bug %] really isn't in 
  there, file a new [% terms.bug %] with your question.

      <p>Most questions and issues submitted to the [% terms.Bugzilla %] are

         cellml-discussion@cellml.org mailing list, which is public and ends
         up in many search engines. This is a good thing, because it means that
         if someone else has the same question as you did, they will be able to

      <p>We do provide the ability to ask private questions, which will only be
         visible to a small, hand-picked group of people. Please only use
         this functionality if you have a very good reason (and include your
         reason in the description above). Please remember that if we are going
         devote our resources to answering your question, it would be polite for
         you to let other read your question and hence prevent us from having to
         answer the same question again, unless you have a good reason. If we
         don't think that there is enough reason to hide a question, we might
         ask you to make it public before we answer it. Also remember that your
         the more people your question is visible to, the more likely you are to
         get a prompt answer. If, after reading this, you still want to make
         your question private, tick the check-box above.</p>

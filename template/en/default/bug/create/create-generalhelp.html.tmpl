          CellML 1.1. I have found that I am duplicating a lot of MathML
          because most of the equations are almost identical between receptors.
          
          I am not currently using imports but I have heard that they may be
          the solution to my problem. I am looking for a feedback on how best
          to use imports to make a complex model. I have looked for examples,
          but have been unable to find any, so I would also be interested to
          know if there are any existing examples out there.

      <p>Most questions and issues submitted to the [% terms.Bugzilla %] are
         publicly visible. Anyone can see them by searching the 
         [% terms.Bugzilla %], and they may be indexed by search engines.
         This is a good thing, because it means that
         if someone else has the same question as you did, they will be able to
         see the answer that was given to you.

      <p>We do provide the ability to ask private questions, which will only be
         visible to a small, hand-picked group of people. Please only use
         this functionality if you have a very good reason (and include your
         reason in the description above). Please remember that if we are going
         devote our resources to answering your question, it would be polite for
         you to let other read your question and hence prevent us from having to
         answer the same question again, unless you have a good reason. If we
         don't think that there is enough reason to hide a question, we might
         ask you to make it public before we answer it. Also remember that your
         the more people your question is visible to, the more likely you are to
         get a prompt answer. If, after reading this, you still want to make
         your question private, tick the check-box above.</p>
